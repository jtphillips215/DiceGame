# DiceGame
Android dice game project

This project worked through the first several weeks of our Android class working through various parts of Android Studio, Java programming, and Android programming.

ToDo list-
  Refactor using design pattern
  Add some form of persistence
  Add preferences for sound and bounce (or remove)
  
The project uses two main activities. One for the game, and one using a recycler view and adapter for the scoreboard. An additional class is used as a controller for the dice
images presented to the user. The data should be persistent. Some other features of android such as dialog fragments, animations, etc. were explored.
